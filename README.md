# Cluster Analysis
The method we use follows the approach developed by Bazellières et al. [[1]](#1). The method consists of three steps
1. Building the correlation matrix
1. Ordering the correlation matrix
3. Identifying the clusters

## Getting Started
Upload the file containing the Z-score matrix (unordered) to Colab and run all cells.
**Try it on Google Colab:**  [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/MinahilRaza/ClusteringAnalysis/blob/main/ClusteringAnalysis.ipynb)
